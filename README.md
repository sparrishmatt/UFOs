# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to utilize javascript and html in order to create a webpage that display and filters data about UFO sightings. The data must be retrieved from a json file, and then seperate filters must be created for date, city, state, etc. This will allow the end user to easily access the specific UFO sightings that they are interested in.  

## Webpage Usage
Since the source json file had so much data, it was important to include different filters in order for the user to be able to find relevant data. The filters that were created are for sighting date, city, state, country, and shape. These filters can be seen below.

Take note of the gray letter which show that those are placeholder filters. When an actual filter is input the text will show up as black.

Here we can see that the 1/10/2010 does indeed show only the UFO sightings from 1/10/2010 as intended. It is also important to to remember that the data for our locations only includes two character entries, which is portrayed in the placeholder filters.

By making use of several filters here, the data can be filtered to just one entry in Butler Missouri on 1/10/2010. It should be stated that the placeholder entries that use capital letters do not actually work if capital letters are put into the filter. This has been changed in the final product to correctly portray how a filter should be entered. 

## Summary and Recommendations
Using the many filters available, anybody should be able to access the specific UFO data that they are interested in in order to run further analysis. However, the current system could be improved upon in several ways. For one, these filters could use a dropdown menu and the option to select multiple items to filter for. This would make the page much more usable for somebody that wanted to quickly access data from two or more locations. 

Another addition would be to add the capability to filter between two dates. All modern reporting systems have this feature and it is one of the most common ways that dates are filtered in this industry. If this were to be added then the functionality of our webpage would greatly benefit.
